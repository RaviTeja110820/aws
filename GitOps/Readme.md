# Deploy To Kubernetes with Jenkins GitOps GitHub Pipeline
we create a Jenkins pipeline with GitOps to deploy code into a Kubernetes cluster. CI part is done via Jenkins and CD part via ArgoCD (GitOps).

Gitops Perodically syncs the running cluster with desired state in Git Repo.


# Steps
1. GitOps Flow
2. Jenkins Installation
3. Jenkins jobs Setup
4. ArgoCD(GitOps) Installation
5. ArgoCD(GitOps) Setup
6. Automating GitHub to jenkins using webhook
7. Zero touch end to end (nirvana!)

# Setup

## Jenkins Installation

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that integrates with a number of AWS Services, including: AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeDeploy, Amazon EC2 Spot, and Amazon EC2 Fleet. You can use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) to deploy a Jenkins application on AWS.

1. Open AWS console , Navigate to Create EC2 and select ubuntu free tier or Amazon Linux 2 AMI and use t2.small.
2. connect to instance using putty or ssh connect. 
3. Use the ssh command to connect to the instance. You will specify the private key (.pem) file and ec2-user@public_dns_name.
```console
$ ssh -i /path/my-key-pair.pem ec2-user@ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```
4. Ensure that your software packages are up to date on your instance by uing the following command to perform a quick software update:
```console
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo yum update â€“y
```
5. Add the Jenkins repo using the following command:
```console
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
```
6. Import a key file from Jenkins-CI to enable installation from the package:
```console
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo yum upgrade
```
7. Install Java:
```console
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y
```
8. ```console
sudo yum install jenkins -y
```
9. Enable the Jenkins service to start at boot:
```console
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo systemctl enable jenkins
```
1. Start Jenkins as a service:
```console
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo systemctl start jenkins
```
1.  You can check the status of the Jenkins service using the command:
```console
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo systemctl status jenkins
```
* Jenkins is now installed and running on your EC2 instance. To configure Jenkins:
  * Connect to http://<your_server_public_DNS>:8080 from your browser. You will be able to access Jenkins through its management interface:

  * As prompted, enter the password found in /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword.Use the following command to display this password:
   ```console
   [ec2-user ~]$ sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
   ```
