# Ansible

Infrastructure as a code is the process of managing and provisioning computing and networking infrastructure and their configuration through machine processable definition files.

You can use interactive configuration tools to define provision and maintain your infrastructure. There are many tools such as terraform, puppet, chef, ansible etc. that can be used to achieve this.


**Ansible** is an open source automation platform that is used for configuration management, application deployment task automation etc.. It can also do IT orchestration to run tasks in sequence and create a chain of events which must happen on several different servers or devices.
