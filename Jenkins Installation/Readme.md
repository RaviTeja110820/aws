   $ ssh -i /path/my-key-pair.pem ec2-user@ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com
   ```

5. Ensure that your software packages are up to date on your instance by uing the following command to perform a quick software update:

   ```console
   [ec2-user ~]$ sudo yum update â€“y
   ```

6. Add the Jenkins repo using the following command:

   ```console
   [ec2-user ~]$ sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
   ```

7. Import a key file from Jenkins-CI to enable installation from the package:

   ```console
   [ec2-user ~]$ sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
   [ec2-user ~]$ sudo yum upgrade
   ```

8. Install Java:

   ```console
   [ec2-user ~]$ sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y
   ```

9. Install Jenkins

   ```console
   sudo yum install jenkins -y
   ```

10. Enable the Jenkins service to start at boot:

   ```console
   [ec2-user ~]$ sudo systemctl enable jenkins
   ```

11. Start Jenkins as a service:

   ```console
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo systemctl start jenkins
```

12. You can check the status of the Jenkins service using the command:

```console
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo systemctl status jenkins
```
